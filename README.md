Project 3: Good VS Evil 3/2/2025

Brick breaker game with juciy features and in a theme of good against evil

## Implementation
Main menu
End-game screen
Music and sound effects
randomize colors for bricks
eyes that follow the ball
score and lives kept track
shake the screen
when brick are broken they fall and fade
particles show when paddle is hit
shader in the background that change colors
comet trail on the ball
paddle also lights up a bit when hit
Everything was made to align with my intent for it to match the theme of
good vs evil, and I hope it seems cohesive to others.
